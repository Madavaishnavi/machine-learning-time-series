# Machine Learning Time Series Projects

This repository includes a set of applied machine learning and statistical modeling projects focused on time series forecasting and anomaly detection. Each sub-project is self-contained and tackles a unique domain challenge using regression models, probabilistic models, and deep learning approaches.
